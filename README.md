# Transhealth App
Live site here: https://transhealth-app.onrender.com
The trans community has always relied on community knowledge from other members. This project is an exercise to revisualize data collected by TransHealth SA of trans-friendly medical practitioners in SA. I'm extremely grateful to TransHealth SA for letting me use part of their data set in the project.

The project is not meant for public use. Please access the page below for the complete and updated directory.

- More data fields displayed on medical practitioner's info page
- Different views (list/ card/ map) of practitioners
